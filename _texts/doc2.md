During one of the coldest n:
war games in the hills behind
night from 7 ’til 11.
Selected sections carried out the
lessons learned in military classes
this quarter. Those classes which
took up the theories of scouting and
patrolling figured most prominently
In the maneuvers, acting as the at­
tacking force.
The problem consisted of two com­
panies and a section of tanks. The
attacking company, composed of
about 125 men under the leadership
of Bill Gordon, had the assignment
of infiltrating through the defense
outposts, commanded by George Kle­
fter, and bring back information con­
cerning the strength of the defense.
Theoretically, there were three com­
panies in bivouac being protected by
the defense outposts. In order to
accomplish this mission of inflltra­
ttlon, It was necessary for the at­
tackers to crawl and creep across
open stretches of fields where the
flares sent up by the defense could
show the slightest movement and
give the position away. Lts. Morgan
and Waddell, who acted as judges,
were pleased that very few of the
attackers were seen and only a
small percentage were eliminated as
wounded.
